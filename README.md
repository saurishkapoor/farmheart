* Current techniques are often: **expensive**, **time-consuming**, and/or **invasive**.  
* These challenges lead to **late detection**, poor prognosis, and economic losses for farmers.


### How It Works:
* Farmers/Veterinarians upload a **retinal image** of cattle.  
* The **YOLOv8n model** analyzes vascular features in the retina.  
* The app provides an **instant CVD/Non-CVD diagnosis** with a confidence score.  


### Results  
- **Accuracy:** 77.5%
