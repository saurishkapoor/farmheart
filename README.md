# AI-Powered Cattle CVD Detection  

# Problem 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in cattle is **difficult to diagnose** due to its **low incidence** and the **limitations of traditional methods**. 
Current techniques are often: **expensive**, **time-consuming**, and/or **invasive**.  
These challenges lead to **late detection**, poor prognosis, and economic losses for farmers.  

## üí° Solution  
This project introduces an **AI-driven, non-invasive diagnostic tool** that uses **retinal fundus imaging** and **deep learning (YOLOv8n)** to detect CVD in cattle.  

**How It Works:** 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Farmers/Veterinarians upload a **retinal image** of cattle.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **YOLOv8n model** analyzes vascular features in the retina.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The app provides an **instant CVD/Non-CVD diagnosis** with a confidence score.  

## üìå Results  
- **Accuracy:** 77.5%  
- **Sensitivity:** 69%
- **Specificity:** 85%  
- **F1-Score:** 75.1%
