# 🩺 AI-Powered Cattle CVD Detection  

## 🚨 Problem  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in cattle is **difficult to diagnose** due to its **low incidence** and the **limitations of traditional methods** (ECG, echocardiography, and blood biomarkers). Current techniques are often:  
- **Expensive** 💰 – Require specialized equipment and trained professionals.  
- **Time-Consuming** ⏳ – Diagnosis is often delayed until symptoms worsen.  
- **Invasive** 🩸 – Blood tests and other physical exams can be stressful for the animal.  
These challenges lead to **late detection**, poor prognosis, and economic losses for farmers.  

## 💡 Solution  
This project introduces an **AI-driven, non-invasive diagnostic tool** that uses **retinal fundus imaging** and **deep learning (YOLOv8n)** to detect CVD in cattle.  

🔹 **How It Works:**  
1️⃣ Farmers/Veterinarians upload a **retinal image** of cattle.  
2️⃣ The **YOLOv8n model** analyzes vascular features in the retina.  
3️⃣ The app provides an **instant CVD/Non-CVD diagnosis** with a confidence score.  

## 📌 Results  
- **Accuracy:** 77.5%  
- **Sensitivity:** 69%
- **Specificity:** 85%  
- **F1-Score:** 75.1%
